<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>
  This repository contains the implementation of a PC-based Notice Board using the 8051 microcontroller. The project is part of Project-Based Learning (PBL-1) and demonstrates the integration of assembly programming with hardware interfacing to create a digital notice board.

The system allows users to input messages via a PC interface, which are then displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen connected to the microcontroller. This innovative approach modernizes traditional bulletin boards, offering real-time updates and enhanced information dissemination capabilities.

<h4>Features:</h4>
Displays messages sent from a PC on a 16x2 LCD screen.
Supports single-line and multi-line message handling.
Handles special characters and scrolling for long messages.
Implements serial communication using the MAX232 IC.
Utilizes 8051 assembly language for precise hardware control.

<h4>Components:</h4>
